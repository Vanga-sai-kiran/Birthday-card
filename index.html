        <h2>Happy Birthday</h2>
        <h3>Dear Friend,</h3>
        <h4 class="letter">Wishing you a very Happy Birthday!!
            You are the most precious gift given to me by god.A Friend like you is rare to find, and I find myself extremely lucky to have you.
                    I always remember what you are done for me.
                    The way you understand and support me is something that cannot be expressed in words.
                    When iam with you,I don't need words to talk because you understand me and my feelings beyond words.
                    I never had someone in my life who made me happy and  who care for me like you 
                    . You are not like others ,you are not fake ,you care, you love me from your whole heart.
          I pray god that our friendship always stays strong, and we keep creating beautiful memories to make this life even more beautiful.finally " you are always on  my mind , forever in my heart &#128151;&#128151;". I love you forever and ever. sending lots of love. &#10084;&#10084;</h4></div>
